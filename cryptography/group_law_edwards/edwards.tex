\date{October 10, 2016}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract} 
  This article gives an elementary computational proof of the group
  law for Edwards elliptic curves following  Bernstein, Lange, et al.,
  Edwards, and Friedl.  The associative law is expressed as a polynomial
  identity over the integers that is directly checked by polynomial division.
  No preliminaries such as intersection numbers, 
  B\'ezout's theorem, projective geometry, divisors,
  or Riemann Roch are required. This article is intended be accessible to
  undergraduate cryptography students.  The proofs have been designed
  to facilitate the formal verification of elliptic curve cryptography.

\section{The Circle}

The unit circle $\ring{C}_1$ in the complex plane $\ring{C}$ is a
group under complex multiplication, or equivalently under the addition
of angles in polar coordinates:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cx}
(x_1,y_1) * (x_2,y_2) = (x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2,x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1).
\end{equation}
We write $\iota(x,y) = (x,-y)$ for complex conjugation, the inverse in
$\ring{C}_1$.

We give an unusual interpretation of the group law on the unit circle
that we call {\it hyperbolic addition}.  We consider the family of
hyperbolas in the plane that pass through the point $z=(-1,0)$ and
whose asymptotes are parallel to the coordinate axes.  The equation of
such a hyperbola has the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:hyp}
x y + p (x+1) + q y = 0.
\end{equation}
All hyperbolas in this article are assumed to be of this form.  As
special cases (such as $x y=0$), this family includes pairs of lines.
 
  Every two points $z_1$ and $z_2$ on the unit circle intersect some
  hyperbola within the family.  This incidence condition uniquely
  determines $p$ and $q$ when $(-1,0)$, $z_1$ and $z_2$ are not
  collinear.  As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}, the hyperbola
  meets the unit circle in one additional point $z_3 = (x_3,y_3)$.
  The following remarkable relationship holds among the three points
  $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$ on the intersection of the circle and
  hyperbola.

\begin{lemma}[hyperbolic addition on the circle] \label{lemma:ha} Let
  $z_0=(-1,0)$, $z_1$, $z_2$ and $z_3$ be four distinct points on the
  intersection of the unit circle with a hyperbola in the family (\ref{eqn:hyp}).  
  Then $z_1 z_2 z_3 = 1$ in $\ring{C}_1$.
\end{lemma}

The lemma is a special case of a more general lemma
(Lemma~\ref{lemma:hyperbola}) that is proved later in this article.

This gives a geometric construction of the group law: the product of
the two points $z_1$ and $z_2$ on the unit circle is $\iota(z_3)$.
Rather than starting with the standard formula for addition in $\ring{C}_1$, 
we can reverse
the process, defining a binary operation $(\oplus)$ on the circle by setting
\[
z_1 \oplus z_2 = \iota(z_3)
\]
whenever $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$ are related by the circle and
hyperbola construction.  We call the binary operation $\oplus$ {\it
  hyperbolic addition} on the circle.

It might seem that there is no point in reinterpreting complex
multiplication on the unit circle as hyperbolic addition, because they
are actually the same binary operation, and the group $\ring{C}_1$ is
already perfectly well-understood.  However, in the next section, we
will see that hyperbolic addition generalizes in ways that ordinary
multiplication does not.  In this sense, we have found a
better description of the group law on the circle.  The same description
works for elliptic curves!

and hyperbola meet at four points $z_0 = (-1,0)$, $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$,
where $z_1 z_2 z_3 = 1$, which we write alternatively in additive notation 
as $z_1\oplus z_2 = \iota(z_3)$.}{

}

% We work a numerical example that is illustrated in
% Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}.  Let $z_1 = (12/13,5/13)$, and $z_2 =
% (7/25,24/25)$ be points on the unit circle coming from the
% Pythagorean triples $12^2 + 5^2 = 13^2$ and $7^2 + 24^2 = 25^2$.
% The hyperbola
%\[
%y = \frac{57 (1+x)} {-15 + 325 x}
%\]
%passes through $z_1$, $z_2$ and $(-1,0)$.  It has vertical asymptote
% $x = 3/65$ and horizontal asymptote $y = 57/325$.  The hyperbola
% also meets the unit circle at $z_3=(-36/325,-323/325)$.  We conclude
% that the the {\it hyperbolic sum} $z_1\oplus z_2$ of $z_1$ and $z_2$
% is $\iota(z_3)=(-36/325,323/325)$.  We can easily directly check our
% result by multiplying $z_1$ and $z_2$ as complex numbers:
%\[
%(\frac{12}{13} + i \frac{5}{13}) (\frac{7}{25} + i \frac{24}{25}) 
%= (-\frac{36}{325} + i \frac{323}{325}).
%\]


\section{Deforming the Circle}

We can use exactly the same hyperbola construction to define a binary
operation $\oplus$ on other curves.  We call this {\it hyperbolic
  addition} on a curve.  We replace the unit circle with a more
general algebraic curve $C$, defined by the zero set of
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ed}
x^2 + c y^2 - 1 - d x^2 y^2
\end{equation} for some parameters $c$ and $d$.
This zero locus of this polynomial is called an {\it Edwards curve}.%
\footnote{This definition is more inclusive than definitions stated elsewhere.  
  Most writers prefer to restrict to curves of genus one
  and generally call a curve with $c\ne 1$ a {\it twisted Edwards curve}.  
  We have interchanged the $x$ and $y$
  coordinates on the Edwards curve to make it 
  consistent with the group law on the circle.}  
The unit circle corresponds to
parameter values $c=1$ and $d=0$.

}
}

We define a binary operation on the Edwards curve by the hyperbolic
addition law described above.  Let $(-1,0)$, $z_1 = (x_1,y_1)$ and
$z_2=(x_2,y_2)$ be three points on an Edwards curve that are not
collinear (to avoid degenerate cases).  We fit a hyperbola of the
usual form (\ref{eqn:hyp}) through these three points, and let $z_3$
be the fourth point of intersection of the hyperbola with the curve.
We define the hyperbolic sum $z_1\oplus z_2$ of $z_1$ and $z_2$ to be
$\iota(z_3)$.  The following lemma gives an explicit formula for
$z_1\oplus z_2 = \iota(z_3)$.

 
 \begin{lemma}\label{lemma:hyp} 
In this construction, the coordinates are given explicitly by
 \begin{equation}\label{eqn:sum}
 \iota(z_3) = \left(\frac{x_1 x_2 - c y_1 y_2}{1 - d x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2},
\frac{x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2}{1+d x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2}\right)
 \end{equation}
 \end{lemma}

 This lemma will be proved below (Lemma~\ref{lemma:hyperbola}).  Until
 now, we have assumed the points $(-1,0)$, $z_1$, and $z_2$ are not
 collinear.  Dropping the assumption of non-collinearity, we turn
 formula (\ref{eqn:sum}) of Lemma~\ref{lemma:hyp} into a definition
 and define the hyperbolic sum
\[
 z_1\oplus z_2 := \iota(z_3).
\]
algebraically by that formula in all cases.  We prove below an affine
closure result (Lemma~\ref{lemma:affine}) showing that the
denominators are always nonzero for suitable parameters $c$ and $d$.

The unit circle belongs to the family of Edwards curves for parameter
values $c=1$ and $d=0$.  In this case, the formula (\ref{eqn:sum})
reduces to the usual group law (\ref{eqn:cx}).

In the next section, we prove quite generally that hyperbolic addition
makes the Edwards curve into a group.

\section{Group Axioms}\label{sec:axiom}

Our primary aim is to give an elementary proof of the group axioms for
hyperbolic addition on Edwards curves (Theorem~\ref{thm:group}).  In
this section, we start afresh, setting aside just about everything,
except for the definition of the Edwards curve (\ref{eqn:ed}) and
the formula (\ref{eqn:sum}).  We shift away from
a geometric language and work entirely algebraically over an arbitrary
field $k$.

\subsection{rings and homomorphisms}

We try to keep our presentation at an undergraduate level.  We will
assume a basic background in abstract algebra at the level of a first
course (rings, fields, homomorphisms, and kernels).  We set things up
in a way that all of the main identities to be proved are identities
of polynomials with integer coefficients.

If $R$ is a ring (specifically, a ring of polynomials with integer
coefficients), and if $\delta\in R$, then we write $R[\f{\delta}]$ for
the localization of $R$ with respect to the multiplicative set
$S=\{1,\delta,\delta^2,\ldots\}$.  That is, $R[\f{\delta}]$ is the
ring of fractions with numerators in $R$ and denominators in $S$.  We
will need the well-known fact that if $\phi:R\to A$ is a ring
homomorphism that sends $\delta$ to a unit in $A$, then $\phi$ extends
uniquely to a homomorphism $R[\f{\delta}]\to A$ that maps a fraction
$g/\delta^i$ to $\phi(g)\phi(\delta^i)^{-1}$.

\begin{lemma}[kernel property] Suppose that an identity $g = r_1 e_1 +
  r_2 e_2 +\cdots + r_k e_k$ holds in a ring $R$.  If $\phi:R\to A$ is
  a ring homomorphism such that $\phi(e_i) =0$ for all $i$, then
  $\phi(g)=0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
$\phi(g) = \sum_{i=1}^k \phi(r_i) \phi(e_i) = 0.$
\end{proof}

We use the following rings: $R_0 := \ring{Z}[c,d]$ and $R_n :=
R_0[x_1,y_1,\ldots,x_n,y_n]$.  We reintroduce the polynomial for the
Edwards curve.  Let
\begin{equation}
e(x,y) = x^2 + c y^2 -1 - d x^2 y^2 \in  R_0[x,y].
\end{equation}



We write $e_i = e(x_i,y_i)$ for the image of the polynomial in $R_j$,
for $i\le j$, under $x\mapsto x_i$ and $y\mapsto y_i$.  Set
$\delta_x = \delta^-$ and $\delta_y = \delta^+$, where
\[\delta^{\pm} (x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2) = 1\pm d x_1 y_1 x_2 y_2\] and
\[
\delta(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2) = \delta_x\delta_y\in R_2.
\]
We write $\delta_{ij}$ for its image of $\delta$ under
$(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2)\mapsto (x_i,y_i,x_j,y_j)$.  So,
$\delta=\delta_{12}$.

\subsection{inverse and closure}

Borrowing the definition of hyperbolic addition from the previous
section, we define a pair of rational functions that we denote using
the symbol $\oplus$:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:add}
(x_1,y_1) \oplus (x_2,y_2) =  \left(\frac{x_1 x_2 - c y_1 y_2}{1 - d x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2},
\frac{x_1 y_2 + y_1 x_2}{1+d x_1 x_2 y_1 y_2}\right) \in R_2[\f{\delta}]\times R_2[\f{\delta}].
\end{equation}
Commutivity is a consequence of the subscript symmetry
$1\leftrightarrow 2$ evident in the pair of rational functions:
\[
(x_1,y_1) \oplus (x_2,y_2) = (x_2,y_2) \oplus (x_1,y_1).
\]
If $\phi:R_2[\f{\delta}]\to A$ is a ring homomorphism, we also write
$(a_1,b_1)\oplus (a_2,b_2)\in A^2$ for the image of $(x_1,y_1)\oplus
(x_2,y_2)$, where $x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2 \mapsto^\phi a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2$.  We
write $\bar e_i=\bar e(a_i,b_i)\in A$ for the image of $e_i$ under
$\phi$.  Geometrically, $\bar e_i=0$ asserts that $(a_i,b_i)$ is a
point on the Edwards curve.  More generally, we often mark the image
$\bar g=\phi(g)$ of an element with a bar accent.

There is an obvious identity element $(1,0)$, expressed as follows.
Under a homomorphism $\phi:R_2[\f{\delta}]\to A$, mapping
$x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2\mapsto a,b,1,0$, we have 
\begin{equation}
(a,b)\oplus(1,0) = (a,b).
\end{equation}

\begin{lemma} [inverse] 
  Let $\phi:R_2[\f{\delta}]\to A$, with $z_1\mapsto P$, $z_2\mapsto \iota(P)$.
  If $e(P)=0$, then $P\oplus \iota(P) = (1,0)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Plug $(a_1,b_1)$ and $(a_1,-b_1)$ into (\ref{eqn:add})
  and simplify using $\bar e_1=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[closure under addition]\label{lemma:closure}
  Let $\phi:R_2[\f{\delta}]\to A$ with $z_i\mapsto P_i$.
  If $e(P_1)=e(P_2)=0$, then
  \[
  e(P_1 \oplus P_2) = 0.
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} This proof serves as a model for several proofs that are
  based on multivariate polynomial division.  We write
\[
e(x_3',y_3') = \frac{g}{\delta^2},\quad \text{ where } 
(x_3',y_3')=(x_1,y_1) \oplus (x_2,y_2) 
\]
for some polynomial $g \in R_2$.  It is enough to show that $\phi(g)=0$.
Polynomial division gives
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:closure}
g= r_1 e_1 + r_2 e_2,
\end{equation}
for some polynomials $r_i\in R_2$.  Concretely, the polynomials $r_i$
are obtained as the output of the one-line Mathematica command
\[
\op{PolynomialReduce}[g,\{e_1,e_2\},\{x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2\}].
\]
The result now follows from the kernel
property and (\ref{eqn:closure}); $\bar e_1 = \bar e_2 = 0$ implies
$\phi(g)= 0$, giving ${\bar e}(a_3,b_3)=0$.
\end{proof}

Although the documentation is incomplete,  {\tt
  PolynomialReduce} seems to be an implementation of a naive
multivariate division algorithm such as \cite{cox1992ideals}.  In
particular, our approach does not require the use of Gr\"obner bases
(except in Lemma \ref{lemma:noco} where they make an easily avoidable
appearance).  We write
\[
g \cong 0 \mod S,
\]
where $g$ is a polynomial and $S$ is a set of polynomials, to indicate
that $g$ has zero remainder when reduced by polynomial
division\footnote{Our computer algebra calculations are available at
  \url{www.github.com/flyspeck}.  This includes a formal verification
  in HOL Light of key polynomial identities.} with respect to $S$
using {\tt PolynomialReduce}.  The zero remainder will give
$\phi(g)=0$ in each application.  Using this approach, most of the
proofs in this article almost write themselves.


\subsection{associativity}

This next step (associativity) is generally considered the hardest
part of the verification of the group law on curves.  Our proof is six lines
and requires little more than polynomial division.  The polynomials
$\delta_x,\delta_y$ appear as denominators in the addition rule.  The
polynomial denominators $\Delta_x,\Delta_y$ that appear when we add twice are
more involved.  Specifically, let $ (x_3',y_3')=(x_1,y_1) \oplus
(x_2,y_2)$, let $(x_1',y_1')=(x_2,y_2) \oplus (x_3,y_3) $, and set
\[
\Delta_x = \delta_x(x_3',y_3',x_3,y_3)
\delta_x(x_1,y_1,x_1',y_1')\delta_{12}\delta_{23}\in R_3.
\]
Define $\Delta_y$ analogously.

\begin{lemma}[generic associativity] \label{lemma:assoc} Let
  $\phi:R_3[\f{\Delta_y\Delta_x}]\to A$ be a homomorphism with $z_i\mapsto P_i$.
  If $e(P_1)=e(P_2)=e(P_3)=0$, then
\[
(P_1 \oplus P_2)\oplus P_3 = 
P_1 \oplus (P_2\oplus P_3).
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The proof is almost identical to the previous proof.  We
  work in the ring $R_3[\f{\Delta_y\Delta_x}]$ and take the
  component-wise difference of the two sides, writing
\[
((x_1,y_1)\oplus (x_2,y_2)) \oplus (x_3,y_3)-
(x_1,y_1)\oplus ((x_2,y_2) \oplus (x_3,y_3)) 
= (\frac{g_1}{\Delta_x},\frac{g_2}{\Delta_y}),
\]
for some polynomials $g_1,g_2 \in R_3$.  
It is enough to show that $\phi(g_1)=\phi(g_2)=0$. 
Polynomial division implies the desired result:
\[
(g_1,g_2)\cong (0,0) \mod \{e_1,e_2,e_3\}.
\]
\end{proof}

\subsection{group law for affine curves}

\begin{lemma}[affine closure] \label{lemma:affine} Let $\phi:R_2\to k$
  be a homomorphism into a field $k$.  If $\phi(\delta)=\bar e_1=\bar
  e_2=0$, then either $\bar d$ or $\bar c \bar d$ is a nonzero square
  in $k$.
\end{lemma}

The lemma is sometimes called completeness, in conflict with the
definition of complete varieties in algebraic geometry.  To avoid
possible confusion, we avoid this terminology.  We use the lemma in
contrapositive to give conditions on $\bar d$ and $\bar c\bar d$ that
imply $\phi(\delta)\ne0$.

\begin{proof} 
  Let $g = (1 - c d y_1^2 y_2 ^2) (1 - d y_1^2 x_2^2)$.  By polynomial
  division,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:squares}
  g \cong 0 \mod \{\delta,e_1,e_2\}.
\end{equation}
This forces $\phi(g)=0$, which by the form of $g$ implies that $\bar
c\bar d$ or $\bar d$ is a nonzero square.
\end{proof}

We are ready to state and prove one of the main results of this
article.  This ``ellipstical'' group law is expressed generally enough
to include the group law on the circle and ellipse as a special case 
$\bar d = 0$.

\begin{theorem}[group law]\label{thm:group} 
  Let $k$ be a field, let $\bar c \in k$ be a square, and let $\bar
  d\not\in k^{\times 2}$.  
  %Let $\bar e(x,y) \in k[x,y]$ be the
  %specialization of $e(x,y)$, obtained by $(c,d)\mapsto (\bar c,\bar
  %d)$.  
  Then 
  \[
  C= \{P\in k^2 \mid \bar e(P) = 0\}
  \]
   is an abelian
  group with binary operation $\oplus$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} This follows directly from the earlier results.  For
  example, to check associativity of $P_1\oplus P_2\oplus P_3$,
  where $P_i\in C$, we define a homomorphism
  $\phi:R_3\to k$ sending $z_i\mapsto P_i$ and
  $(c,d)\mapsto (\bar c,\bar d)$.  By a repeated use of the affine
  closure lemma, $\phi(\Delta_y\Delta_x)$ is nonzero and invertible in
  the field $k$.  The universal property of localization extends
  $\phi$ to a homomorphism $\phi:R_3[\f{\Delta_y\Delta_x}]\to k$.  By
  the associativity lemma applied to $\phi$, we obtain the
  associativity for these three (arbitrary) elements of $C$.  The
  other properties follow similarly from the lemmas on closure,
  inverse, and affine closure.
\end{proof}

The Mathematica calculations in this section are fast. For example,
the associativity certificate takes about $0.12$ second to compute on
a 2.13 GHz processor.  Once the Mathematica code was in final form, it
took less than 30 minutes of development time in HOL Light to copy the
polynomial identities over to the proof assistant and formally verify
them.  All the polynomial identities in this section combined can be
formally verified in less than 2 seconds. The most difficult formal
verification is the associativity identity which takes about 1.5
seconds.

Working with the Weierstrass form of the curve, Friedl was the first
to give a proof of the associative law of elliptic curves in a
computer algebra system (in Cocoa using Gr\"obner bases)
\cite{friedl}.  He writes, ``The verification of some identities took
several hours on a modern computer; this proof could not have been
carried out before the 1980s.''  These identities were eventually
formalized in Coq with runtime 1 minute and 20 seconds
\cite{thery2007proving}.  A noncomputational Coq
formalization based on the Picard group appears in
\cite{bartzia2014formal}.  By shifting to Edwards curves, we have
significantly improved the speed of the computational proof.

\section{Group law for projective Edwards curves}

By proving the group laws for a large class of elliptic curves,
Theorem \ref{thm:group} is sufficiently general for many applications
to cryptography.  Nevertheless, to achieve complete generality, we
push forward.

This section show how to remove the restriction $\bar d\not\in
k^{\times 2}$ that appears in the group law in the previous section.
By removing this restriction, we obtain a new proof of the group law
for all elliptic curves in characteristics different from $2$.
Unfortunately, in this section, some case-by-case arguments are
needed.

The basic idea of our construction that if $\Eoo$ is the set of
$k$-valued points on the affine Edwards curve with nonzero
coordinates, then the set of points $G$ on the curve outside $\Eoo$ on
the projective curve is actually an abelian group of order eight that
acts as automophisms of $\Eoo$.  We obtain a binary operation on the
set $E=\Eoo\sqcup G$ by merging hyperbolic addition on $\Eoo$ with the
group action of $G$ on $\Eoo$.  It will be associative by the
underlying associativity of the binary operations that are merged.

\subsection{definitions}

Let $k$ be a field of characteristic different from $2$.  In this
section, we assume that $c\ne 0$ and that $c$ and $d$ are both
squares.  Let $t^2 = d/c$.  By a change of variable $y\mapsto
y/\sqrt{c}$, the Edwards curve takes the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:t}
e(x,y)= x^2 + y^2 -1 - t^2 x^2 y^2.
\end{equation}

We assume $t^2\ne 1$.  Note if $t^2=1$, then Equation (\ref{eqn:t})
becomes
\[
(1-x^2)(1-y^2),
\]
and the curve degenerates to a product of lines, which cannot be a
group.  We also assume that $t\ne 0$, which excludes the circle, which
has already been fully treated.  Shifting notation for this new
setting, let
\[
R_0 = \ring{Z}[t,\frac{1}{t^2-1},\frac1t],\quad
R_n = R_0[x_1,y_1,\ldots,x_n,y_n].
\]
As before, we write $e_i = e(x_i,y_i)$, and $\bar e_i = \phi(e_i)$ when a
homomorphism $\phi$ is given.

Let $\Eaff$ be the set of solutions of Equation (\ref{eqn:t}) with
$(x,y)\in k^2$.
Let $\Eoo\subset \Eaff$ be the set of solutions of Equation (\ref{eqn:t}) with
nonzero coordinates $x,y\in k^\times$.
% in the field $k$.  Let $\Eoo\subset \Eo$ be the set
%of points such that $x\ne0$ and $y\ne 0$.

Let $G$ be the abelian group of order eight generated by the following
two permutations $\rho,\tau$ of the set $\Eoo$:
\[
\rho(x,y) = (-y,x),\quad \tau(x,y) = (1/(tx),1/(ty)).
\]
It is immediate that these two permutations carry $\Eoo$ to $\Eoo$.

Define $E = G\sqcup \Eoo$.  We will show that $E$ can be made into a
group.  The binary operation 
combines $\oplus$ with the action of $G$ on $\Eoo$.

%Let $[g] = g(1,0)\in \Eo$.  Then $\{[g]\mid g\in \Go\} = \Eo \setminus
%\Eoo$ and $[g]\oplus Q = g Q$, for $g\in \Go$ and $Q\in \Eoo$.

%We define an action $G\times E\to E$ by
%\[
%(g,P)\mapsto \begin{cases}g P,& P\in \Eoo;\\
%g g_1,& P = g_1\in G.
%\end{cases}
%\]
%This is indeed an action of $G$ on $E$ because
% $G$ acts on $\Eoo$ and on $G$ by left multiplication.

\begin{lemma}  \label{lemma:no-fix}
  $G$ acts without fixed point on $\Eoo$.  That is, $g P = P$ implies
  that $g=1_G\in G$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} 
%If $P=g_1\in G$, then $g g_1 = g_1$ clearly implies that
%  $g=1_G$.  
  If $g = \rho^k\ne 1_G$, then $g P = P$ implies that $t x y = - t x
  y$ and $x=y=0$, which is not a point on the curve.  If $g = \tau
  \rho^k$, then the fixed-point condition $g P = P$ leads to $t x^2 =
  t y^2 =\pm 1$.  Such a point can lie on the curve only when $t^2=1$,
  which is contrary to our standing assumption.
\end{proof}

\subsection{extended addition}

We extend the binary operation $\oplus$ using the automorphism $\tau$.
We modify notation slightly to write $\oplus_0$ for the binary
operation denoted $\oplus$ until now, reserving $\oplus$ for the
extension about to be defined.

The idea is to
set 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:tauplus}
P\oplus_1 Q := \tau((\tau P)\oplus_0 Q) = \tau(P\oplus_0 \tau Q).
\end{equation}
More formally, calculating the right-hand side in terms of
coordinates, we define $(\oplus_1)$ by a pair of rational functions
\[
(x_1,y_1)\oplus_1 (x_2,y_2) := \left(\frac{x_1y_1 - x_2 y_2}{x_2
    y_1-x_1 y_2},\frac{x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2}{x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2}\right) 
    \in R_2[\f{\delta_1}].
\]
We introduce notation for the denominators:
\[
\delta_{1x}(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2) = x_2 y_1 - x_1 y_2,
\quad \delta_{1y}(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2)= x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2,
\quad \delta_1 = \delta_{1x} \delta_{1y}.
\] 
\smallskip


\begin{lemma}[closure]
  Let $\phi:R_2[\f{\delta_1}]\to A$ with $z_i\mapsto P_i$.  If
  $e(P_1)=e(P_2)=0$, then
  \[
  e(P_1\oplus_1 P_2) = 0.
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Follow the proof of Lemma \ref{lemma:closure} to reduce
  to an identity
\[
g\cong 0 \mod \{e_1,e_2\}.
\].
\end{proof}


We read subscripts of $\oplus$ and $\delta$
modulo $2$, writing $\oplus_i$ with $i\in\ring{Z}/2\ring{Z}$.
The domain of $\oplus_i$ is
\[
\Eaf{i} := \{(P,Q)\in \Eaff^2\mid \delta_i(P,Q)\ne0\}.
\]
Whenever we write $P\oplus_i Q$, it is always accompanied by
the implicit assertion that 
$(P,Q)\in \Eaf{i}$.

Let $\ang{\rho}\to \Eaff$ be the map given by 
\[
g\mapsto g(1,0)\in\{\pm (1,0),\pm (0,1)\} = \Eaff\setminus \Eoo.
\]

The following coherence lemma shows that we get the same answer
whenever we have two composition laws to choose from.

\begin{lemma}[coherence] \label{lemma:extend} 
\par
\noindent
  % Let $\phi:R_2[\f{\delta_1\delta}]\to A$ be a homomorphism sending
  % $x_i,y_i\mapsto a_i,b_i$.  Assume $\bar e_1 = \bar e_ 2 = 0$. Then
%\[
%(a_1,b_1)\oplus (a_2,b_2)=(a_1,b_1)\oplus_1 (a_2,b_2).
%\]
\begin{itemize}
\item For all $(P,Q)\in \Eaf0 \cap \Eaf1$, we have
\[
P \oplus_0 Q = P\oplus_1 Q.
\]
\item
For all $g_1,g_2\in \ang{\rho}$ and all $P\in \Eaff$, we have
\[
[g_1]\oplus_0 P = g_1 P,\quad\text{and}\quad [g_1]\oplus[g_2]=[g_1 g_2].
\]
\item If $Q = g P^{-1}$ and $(P,Q)\in \Eaf{i}$, then
\[
P\oplus_i Q = g.
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} To prove the first statement, write
\[
((x_1,y_1)\oplus (x_2,y_2)) -
((x_1,y_1)\oplus_1 (x_2,y_2) ) = 
(\frac{g_1}{\delta_y\delta_{1x}},\frac{g_2}{\delta_x\delta_{1y}}),
\]
for some polynomials $g_1,g_2$.   Polynomial division gives
\[
(g_1,g_2) \cong (0,0) \mod \{e_1,e_2\}.
\]

Turing to the second statement, if $g_1\in \ang{\rho}$, then
\[
[g_1]\oplus_0 P_2 = (x_1 x_2-y_1 y_2,x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_1);
\]
that is, the group law for the circle.  $g_1=\rho^j$ and $[\rho^j]$
both act by rotation by angle $\pi j/2$.

In the final statement, the intersection of $G$ with the range of
$\Eaf{i}$ gives $g\in G\cap \Eaff = \ang{\rho}$.  It is enough to
check the statement on the generator $g =\rho$.  Use the following
tautological identity of rational functions (no polynomial division is
required).  We have $(P,Q)\in \Eaf{i}$ iff $(P,\rho Q)\in \Eaf{i}$ and
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:rho-plus}
P\oplus_i \rho Q =  \rho(P\oplus_i Q).
\end{equation}
\end{proof}

%Using coherence, we define $\oplus_1'$ on the domain
%\begin{align*}
%\{(P,Q)\in \Eoo\times \Eoo &\mid 
%\delta(P,Q)\ne 0 \vee
%\delta_1(P,Q)\ne 0 \},
%\end{align*}
%that restricts to $\oplus$ and $\oplus_1$ where their denominators
% are nonzero.

\subsection{dichotomy}

\begin{lemma}[dichotomy]\label{lemma:noco} 
  Let $P,Q\in \Eoo$.  Then either $Q=g P^{-1}$ for some $g\in
  \tau\ang{\rho}$, or $(P,Q)\in \Eaf{i}$ for some $i$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} 
  Assuming
  \[
  \delta_0(P,Q) = \delta_{0x}(P,Q)\delta_{0y}(P,Q)=0,\quad\text{and}\quad
  \delta_1(P,Q) = \delta_{1x}(P,Q)\delta_{1y}(P,Q)=0,
  \]
  we show that $Q = g P^{-1}$ for some $g\in G$.
  Replacing $Q$ by $\rho Q$ if needed, which exchanges
  $\delta_x\leftrightarrow \delta_y$, we may assume that
  $\delta_x(P,Q)=0$.  Set $\tau Q = Q_0 = (a_0,b_0)$ and
  $P=(a_1,b_1)$.  

We claim that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:gp-}
(a_0,b_0) \in \{\pm (b_1,a_1)\} \subset \Go P^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Write $\delta',\delta_{+},\delta_{-}$ for $x_0 y_0\delta_x$,
$t x_0 y_0\delta_{1x}$, and $t x_0 y_0 \delta_{1y}$ respectively,
each evaluated at $(P,\tau(Q_0))=(x_1,y_1,1/(t x_0),1/(t y_0))$. 
(The factors $x_0y_0$
and $t x_0 y_0$ have been included to clear denominators, leaving us
with polynomials.)

We have two cases $\pm$, according to $\delta_{\pm}=0$.
In each case, let
\[
S_\pm = \text{Gr\"obner basis of } \{e_1,e_2, 
\delta',\delta_{\pm},q x_0 x_1 y_0 y_1 - 1\}.
\]
The polynomial $q x_0 x_1 y_0 y_1-1$ is included to encode the
condition $a_0,b_0,a_1,b_1\ne 0$, which holds on $\Eoo$.  Polynomial
division gives
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:dichot}
(x_0^2-x_1^2,y_0^2-x_1^2,x_0 y_0 - x_1 y_1) \cong (0,0,0) \mod S_\pm.
\end{equation}
These equations immediately yield $(a_0,b_0) = \pm (b_1,a_1)$ and
(\ref{eqn:gp-}).  This gives the claim.

%In the second case, let
%\[
% = \text{Gr\"obner basis of } \{e_1,e_2, 
%\delta_{y0},\delta_{-0}_1,q x_0 x_1 y_0 y_1 - 1\}.
%\]
%Polynomial division again gives Equations (\ref{eqn:dichot}) and 
%(\ref{eqn:gp-}).  

In summary, we have $\tau Q = Q_0 = (a_0,b_0) = g P^{-1}$, for some
$g\in \Go$.  Then $Q = \tau g P^{-1}$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{group law}

We have a partial composition law 
$\oplus:\Eaff\times\Eaff\to E$ given by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:dicho}
P\oplus Q = \begin{cases}
g & \text{if } Q = g P^{-1},\\
P\oplus_i Q & \text{if } (P,Q)\in \Eaf{i}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The element $g\in G$ that appears is uniquely determined by Lemma
\ref{lemma:no-fix}.  
We immediately extend this to a binary operation $\oplus:E\times E\to
E$ by the following table which indicates which composition law to use for
$P,Q\in E= G\sqcup \Eoo$:

{
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l || l | l}
$P\oplus Q$ & $G$ & $\Eoo$ \\ \hline \hline
$G$ & group law & action of $G$ on $\Eoo$\\
$\Eoo$ & action of $G$ on $\Eoo$ & dichotomy (\ref{eqn:dicho}).
\end{tabular}
}


%We define a group structure on $E$ by merging the binary operations
%that are available.  We define addition $\hplus$ by
%\begin{equation}
%P\hplus Q = \begin{cases}
%g_1 g_2,& P = g_1, Q = g_2 \in G;\\
%g_1 Q,& P = g_1\in G,  Q\in \Eoo;\\
%g_2 P,& P \in \Eoo, Q = g_2\in G;\\
%g,& Q = g P^{-1}, P,Q\in \Eoo, g\in G;\\
%P\oplus_i Q,&\text{otherwise}.
%\end{cases}
%\end{equation}
%By Lemma \ref{lemma:noco}, $(\oplus_i)$ has nonzero denominator
%in the final case.   
By coherence, any composition law can be used on
overlapping domains where more than one operation is defined.

\begin{lemma}[inverse]\label{lemma:inv2} 
The binary operation $(\hplus)$ is abelian, has identity
  element $1_G\in G$, and has a inverse, which
   is given by $g\mapsto g^{-1}$ for $g\in G$
  and $P\mapsto P^{-1} = (x,-y)$ for $P=(x,y)\in \Eoo$.  Moreover, 
  $(g P)^{-1} = g^{-1} P^{-1}$, for all $g\in G$ and $P\in E$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} These are routine verifications.  It is enough to 
verify the final statement on generators $g=\tau,\rho$ of $G$.
\end{proof}

% $1_G\in G\subset E$ serves as the group identity element.  Note that
% $1_G\in G$ the identity defined earlier for Edwards curve addition.
% The inverse $P\mapsto P^{-1}$ is $g\mapsto g^{-1}$ on $G$ and
% $(x,y)\mapsto (x,-y)$ on $\Eoo$.  From here on, we write the inverse
% on $\Eoo$ in multiplicative notation $P\mapsto P^{-1}$.  It is
% easily checked that for all $P,Q\in E$, and all $g\in G$ we have
%\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cid}
%P\hplus Q = Q\hplus P,\quad 
%1_G \hplus P = P,\quad P^{-1} 
%\hplus P = 1_G,\quad (g P)^{-1} = g^{-1} P^{-1}
%\end{equation}
%Also, if $g\in \Go$ and $P\in \Eo$, then
%\[
% g P = [g]\oplus P = [g] \oplus_1 P.
%\]

\begin{theorem}[associativity]\label{lemma:pseudo} 
  For all $P,Q,R\in E$, we have
\[
(P\hplus Q)\hplus R = P \hplus (Q\hplus R).
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}  
  We break the proof into a series of intermediate identities.  Our
  first identity is that for all $g\in G$ and all $P,Q\in E$, we have
\[
P\hplus (g Q) = g (P\hplus Q).
\]
Note that this is a special case of associativity, when $R=g\in G$.  
Easy case splits according to $G\sqcup
\Eoo$ reduce the proof to $P,Q\in \Eoo$ and $\hplus =\oplus_i$.  It is
then enough to check the equation on the generators $g=\rho,\tau$ of
$G$.  For $\rho$, this reduces to Equation (\ref{eqn:rho-plus}); and
for $\tau$, it is precisely the coherence identity (Lemma
\ref{lemma:extend}).  This gives the identity.  We use this
identity without further comment to cancel any elements of $G$ that
appear on both sides of an equation.

Next we show that for all $i,j,k,\ell\in \ring{Z}/2\ring{Z}$, and all
$P,Q,R\in \Eoo$, with the obvious domain constraints, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:assoc-affine}
(P\oplus_i Q) \oplus_j R = P \oplus_k (Q \oplus_\ell R),
\end{equation}
which we prove by polynomial division in the same manner as
Lemma \ref{lemma:assoc}, which is one of the cases.  (We might try to
reduce the number of cases by making systematic use of identities
$(\tau^i P\oplus\tau^j Q)\oplus \tau^k R = \tau^{i+j+k} ((P\oplus
Q)\oplus R)$, but we do not pursue that here.) A special case of this
identity is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:semiaffine}
(P\oplus_i Q) \oplus_j Q^{-1} = P.
\end{equation}

We claim that 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:g-cancel}
P\oplus Q = g\in G\quad\Rightarrow\quad P = g Q^{-1}.
\end{equation}
This is an easy consequence of definitions if $P\in G$, $Q\in G$, or
$Q = g_1 P^{-1}$.  Otherwise, by dichotomy, we reduce to the affine
calculation
\[
P = (P\oplus_i Q)\oplus_j Q^{-1} = [g]\oplus_j Q^{-1} = g Q^{-1}.
\]

We claim that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cancel}
P \oplus Q = Q \quad \Rightarrow\quad P = 1_G.
\end{equation}
This is an easy consequence of definitions if $P\in G$, $Q\in G$, or
$Q = gP^{-1}$.  Otherwise, by dichotomy, we reduce to the affine
calculation using (\ref{eqn:semiaffine})
\[
1_G = (Q \oplus_j Q^{-1}) = (P\oplus_i Q)\oplus_j Q^{-1} = P.
\]

We claim that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:semi}
(P\oplus Q)\oplus Q^{-1} = P.
\end{equation}
This is an easy consequence of definitions if $P\in G$, $Q\in G$, or
$Q = gP^{-1}$.  Otherwise, by (\ref{eqn:g-cancel}), $P\oplus G\not\in
G$, and by (\ref{eqn:cancel}) $P\oplus Q$ does not have the form $g
Q$.  By dichotomy, we reduce to an affine calculation, which is
(\ref{eqn:semiaffine}).

Finally, we prove general associativity.  This is an easy consequence
of definitions if $P\in G$, $Q\in G$, or $R\in G$.  If $P\oplus Q\in
G$, $Q\oplus R\in G$, $(P\oplus Q)\oplus R\in G$, or $P\oplus (Q\oplus
R)\in G$, then the identity reduces to (\ref{eqn:semi}).  Otherwise,
by dichotomy, we reduce to the affine calculation
(\ref{eqn:assoc-affine}).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[group law] $E$ is an abelian group under addition $\hplus$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} This follows from earlier observations about the
  identity element, inverse (Lemma \ref{lemma:inv2}), and
  associativity (Lemma \ref{lemma:pseudo}).
\end{proof}

We remark that our definition of addition on the curve $E$ is
essentially equivalent to the definition in
\cite{bernstein2011complete}.  A cosmetic difference is that we label
points at infinity by $g\in G$, rather than using projective
coordinates.  The action of $G$ on $\Eoo$ extends to an action on
$\ring{P}^1_k\times \ring{P}^1_k$.  Let $[g] = g (1,0)\in
\ring{P}^1_k\times \ring{P}^1_k$.  Then $\Eoo\sqcup \{[g]\mid g\in
G\}$ is the projective Edwards curve in $\ring{P}^1_k\times \ring{P}^1_k$.
This gives the translation from our representation to that of
\cite{bernstein2011complete}.

\section{Hyperbola revisited}

Our proof of the group axioms in the previous section does not
logically depend on the geometric interpretation of addition as
intersection points with a hyperbola.  Here we show that the addition
formula (\ref{eqn:sum}) is indeed given by hyperbolic addition (when a
determinant $D$ is nonzero).  We revert to the meaning of $R_0$ and
$R_n$ from Section \ref{sec:axiom}.

\subsection{addition}

Three points $(x_0,y_0)$, $(x_1,y_1)$, and $(x_2,y_2)$ in the plane
are collinear if and only if the following determinant is zero:
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
x_0 & y_0 & 1\\
x_1 & y_1 & 1\\
x_2 & y_2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}.
\]
When $(x_0,y_0) = (-1,0)$, the determinant
is $D= (x_1+1) y_2 - (x_2+1) y_1\in R_2$. 
We recall the polynomial
\[
h(p,q,x,y) = x y + p (x+1) + q y \in R_0[p,q,x,y]
\]
representing a family of hyperbolas.
We can solve the two linear equations
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:pq}
h(p,q,x_1,y_1)=h(p,q,x_2,y_2)=0
\end{equation}
uniquely for $p=p_0$ and $q=q_0$ in the ring $R_2[\f{D}]$ to obtain
$h(x,y) = h(p_0,q_0,x,y) \in R_2[\f{D}][x,y]$.  It represents the
unique hyperbola in the family passing through points and $(-1,0)$,
$(x_1,y_1)$, and $(x_2,y_2)$.
 
\begin{lemma}[hyperbolic addition]\label{lemma:hyperbola}
  Let $\phi:R_2[\f{D\delta}]\to A$ be a ring homomorphism sending
  $x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2\mapsto a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2$.  Let $(a_3,b_3) =
  (a_1,b_1)\oplus (a_2,b_2)$.  If $\bar e_1 = \bar e_2 = 0$, then
  $\bar h(a_3,-b_3) = 0$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We work in the ring $R_2[\f{D\delta}]$ and write
\[
h(x_3',-y_3') = \frac{g}{D\delta},\quad 
\text{where } (x_3',y_3') = (x_1,y_1)\oplus (x_2,y_2)
\]
for some polynomial $g \in R_2$.  Polynomial division gives
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:h}
g \cong 0 \mod \{e_1,e_2\}.
\end{equation}
\end{proof}

\subsection{group law based on divisors}

In this subsection, we sketch a second proof of the group law for
Edwards curves that imitates a standard proof for the chord and
tangent construction for Weierstrass curves.

Here we work over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic
different from $2$.

\begin{theorem} Let $E$ be an Edwards curve of genus $1$ with
  $k$-points $E(k)\subset \ring{P}_k^1\times \ring{P}_k^1$.  Then
  $E(k)$ is a group under hyperbolic addition.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof sketch] 
  Each hyperbola in the family (\ref{eqn:hyp}) determines a rational
  function in the function field of $E$:
\[
\frac{x y + p (x+1) + q y}{x y}.
\]
Its divisor has the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:h}
[P] + [Q] + [R] - [(1,0)] - [(0,1)] - [(0,-1)],
\end{equation}
for some points $P,Q,R\in E(k)$.  By the definition of hyperbolic
addition, $\iota(R) = P\oplus Q$.  Conversely, three points on the Edwards
curve that sum to $0$ determine a rational function in the family (by solving
Equation (\ref{eqn:pq}) for $p$ and $q$ using any two of the three points). We
consider six rational function $f_1,f_2,f_3,f_1',f_2',f_3'$
constructed in this manner, where each rational function is specified
by three points of $E(k)$ as indicated in Figure {\ref{fig:9pt}}.  Each line
segment in the figure represents a hyperbola in our family.

We compute the divisor using (\ref{eqn:h})
\[
\op{div} (f) =\op{div}\left(\frac{f_1 f_2 f_3}{f_1' f_2' f_3'}\right) = 
[P\oplus (Q\oplus R)] - [(P\oplus Q) \oplus R].
\]
Other poles and zeros occur twice with opposite sign.
If the two points on the right are distinct, the function $f$ has a
simple zero and a solitary simple pole.  Such a function does not
exist on a curve of positive genus, so $f$ is constant, $\op{div}(f)=0$, and
\[
P\oplus (Q\oplus R) = (P\oplus Q) \oplus R.
\]
\end{proof}

 \tikzfig{9pt}{We define six hyperbolas in our family (each represented here as
 a line segment),
specifying each by their three non-fixed points on $E$.
The three given points on each hyperbola sum to zero.}{

Unlike our first proof, this proof is not self-contained because we
rely on the fact that on a curve of genus one, no function 
has a single simple pole.


\subsection{Elliptic Curves}\label{sec:elliptic}

Assume in this section that the characteristic of the field is not
$2$.

Starting with the equation $x^2 (1-d y^2) = (1 - c y^2)$ of the
Edwards curve, we can multiply both sides by $(1- d y^2)$ to bring it
into the form
\[
w^2 = (1 - d y^2) (1 - c y^2),
\]
where $w = x (1 - d y^2)$.  This a Jacobi quartic.  It is an elliptic
curve whenever the polynomial in $y$ on the right-hand side has degree
four and is separable.  In particular, if $c=1$ and $d=t^2\ne 1$, it
is an elliptic curve.

After passing to a quadratic extension if necessary, every elliptic
curve is isomorphic to an Edwards curve.  This observation can be used
to give a new proof that a general elliptic curve $E$ (say chord and
tangent addition in Weierstrass form) is a group.  To carry this out,
write the explicit isomorphism $E\to E'$ to an Edwards curve taking
the binary operation $\oplus_E$ on $E$ to the group operation on the
Edwards curve.  Then associativity for $\oplus_E$ follows from
associativity on the Edwards curve.

A number of calculations are reworkings of calculations found in
Edwards, Bernstein, Lange et al.~\cite{edwards2007normal},
\cite{bernstein2008twisted}, \cite{bernstein2007faster}.  Inspiration
for this article comes from Bernstein and Lange's wonderfully gentle
introduction to elliptic-curve cryptography at the 31st Chaos
Communication Congress in December, 2014.  They use the group law on
the circle to motivate the group law on Edwards elliptic curves.
Hyperbolic addition is introduced for Edwards elliptic curves in
\cite{arene2011faster}.
